# LuxLauncher

Some of today's launchers are gradually becoming bloated
(especially the Chinese ones, which seem to be less launchers and more like toolboxes?)

LuxLauncher aims to solve such problems.
LuxLauncher is a fast, easy-to-use launcher for Minecraft.

It will only provide some essential features, and users can have more room for customization

## Development

Blind PR submission is obviously possible, but it may not be accepted.

We're not looking for flashy features, but to build on what's already there to make it more stable and easier to use.

### Code formatting

Just follow the existing formatting.

* Make sure your IDE is not messing up line endings or whitespace and avoid using linters.
* Make the code easy to read.
* Keep to the existing formatting.
* Indent with 4 space.
